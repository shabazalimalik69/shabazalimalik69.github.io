          I recently completed a rewarding three-month internship at Zimyo, where I had the opportunity to work on several projects involving WhatsApp chatbot integration and backend API development. During my time at Zimyo, I gained valuable experience in the entire software development life cycle, from requirement gathering to testing and deployment.

 My primary focus was on integrating a WhatsApp chatbot into Zimyo's existing system, allowing users to access essential HR services and interact with the company's HR platform seamlessly. I collaborated closely with a cross-functional team of developers, UI/UX designers, and product managers to ensure a smooth integration process and an exceptional user experience. Through this project, I honed my skills in API integration, webhook configuration, and building conversational user interfaces.

 In addition to the chatbot integration, I also worked on developing backend APIs to support various features of Zimyo's platform. I actively contributed to the design and implementation of RESTful APIs, database schema design, and data modeling. My experience in this area has given me a solid understanding of scalable architecture and best practices for building robust and secure web applications.
